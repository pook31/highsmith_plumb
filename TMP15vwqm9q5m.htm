                <font size="+1"> When I first started my career I knew what I 
                wanted to do. Run a small plumbing business with my family.<br>
                <br>
                I was lucky and had a chance to work for some great plumbers. 
                Some taught me how to be honest, hard working and always put the 
                customer&#8217;s needs first. Some showed me how not to treat 
                a customer. It gave me the opportunity to keep the good habits 
                and avoid the bad business techniques that so often ruin customer 
                relationships. I wanted to become the kind of plumber that helps 
                my customer with their plumbing problems and keeps them as a customer. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Early on I noticed that most mom and pop (small family) plumbers 
                that I worked for were named &#8220;Smith and Sons&#8221; or &#8220;Jones 
                and Sons&#8221;. So I always figured that when the time came to 
                start my own plumbing company I would name it &#8220;Highsmith 
                and Sons&#8221;. As my family grew it seemed there was a small 
                issue. Our family was blessed with two beautiful daughters. They 
                are still young and I wanted them to know that I would be very 
                proud to have them follow in my footsteps. So &#8220;Highsmith 
                and Daughters Plumbing&#8221; was born. </font></font></font>
